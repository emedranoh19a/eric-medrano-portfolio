Hi chat! I want you to help me to create 2 files, a css and a javascript file:

Firstly, the css file is a tailwindCSS theme, you have to set the color palette, and the typography, according to the attached files of this prompt. 
Please leave the body class like that. Here is the format I want you to use. Please, don't comment the css with detail. Only the Color palette section (in the inline), and the typography section (before writing all the preset classes).

@import "tailwindcss";
@theme inline {
  --font-{{fontName}}: var(--{{fontName}}-next);

  --color-purple-300: #a775f1;
  --color-purple-500: #733fc8;
}

@layer utilities { 
  .preset-1 {
    @apply text-[1.25rem] leading-[120%] tracking-normal font-semibold;
  }
... (other presets go here)
}

.body {
 }

---------------------

Secondly, I want you to look at the other photo I attached (the directory), and write a javascript file that exports everyAsset as following:

export {default as assetName} from "./images/asset-name.*extension*"

*Please be careful when copying the name and the extension correctly. Convert and export it as camelCase, and assume that every asset is inside the    "images" folder.
