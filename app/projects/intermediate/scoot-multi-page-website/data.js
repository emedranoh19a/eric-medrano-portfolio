        question: "How about the rules & regulations?",
        answer: "Now is not the time to be a rule breaker. Be sure you're complying with all local laws and  regulations. Also, just be a good human being. Be sure not to park your Scoot where it can  block access to buildings or get in people's way."

        question: "What if I damage my Scoot?",
