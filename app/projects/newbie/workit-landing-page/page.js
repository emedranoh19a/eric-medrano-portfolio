//TODO: 
//Get familiar with the figma file
//Markup of the content, as it is in Figma.
//Generate the Typography for this page
//Get the variables for the palette colors
//Figure out what else.

// Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

// You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

// Your users should be able to:

// - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
// - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
